# Bare-Metal SPI Driver (Flight Software)

This module is an application-layer SPI driver written at a register level for use by flight-software — i.e., it has no HAL, no vendor libraries, etc. It builds upon the lower-level "platform" layer provided in the main repository as previously committed to this project — it adds bring up of the SPI's clock and control registers, brings up modes and selects chips to be selected, and implements determinate transmit (TX) and receive (RX) operations between SPI devices for both hardware-in-the-loop testing and tightly coupled firmware development and integration. This module was designed for reliable operation, repeatable operation, and to allow users to have full control over all timing and bus operations.
